# Sets (DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE):
# Primitive config reader. Do not deviate from this setup
# Hashtags are comments
# You can add infinite potion effects, NOTE: potion effect amplifiers start at 0, meaning 0 = 1
# Name of set MUST contain _SET, the rest is up to you.
# If you use "_" anywhere in your name it will be show incomplete ingame, so I would advise agains using it.
# Spaces and any other characters are fine though
# If you want an armor slot to be anything, simply put AIR instead of an armor type
# Note: Only one set bonus can be active at any time, so if sets overlap it will select only one of them.
